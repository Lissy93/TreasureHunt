## The Treasure Hunt App

>**TL;DR**: I made another pointless Android app, with a hidious UI and no real world uses

### Intro 
A fully-functional native Android app that allows users 
to create, share, and complete treasure hunts (aka, pub crawls).
Developed just as a learning exercise, to try out the update Google Maps API, 
and Async POST and GET requests, as well practicing implementing some common design patterns in Java.

.... Yeah yeah- I know what your thinking

![Thet UI is so gross, that my eyes are actually burning](https://media1.tenor.com/images/e57b700d3e915754861565542d865f01/tenor.gif?itemid=5183364)

... I never pretended I was any good at UI
